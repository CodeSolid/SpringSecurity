SpringSecurity
==============

This is the source code for a forthcoming presentation about Spring Security.

The plan for the presentation is to include:

* A drop-dead-simple demo showing how to set up basic http authentication in a few minutes using Spring Boot.  This is already here as branches step1 - step3.
* A starter app for password-based security using a UserDetails service.  We will also add the ability to log in using Facebook or Twitter.  This code will 
be an abstraction of the security layer of [Goalboost](http://www.goalboost.com)'s use of Spring Security, which time permitting will be made more Spring-Boot like (use Java configuration in lieu of XML).
* Information about of role-based security and security annotations.
* An Oauth2 demo "based on" (or perhaps consisting of), Roy Clarkson's [Spring Oauth REST Service](https://github.com/royclarkson/spring-rest-service-oauth) starter project.

And maybe:

* Some sort of LDAP example
