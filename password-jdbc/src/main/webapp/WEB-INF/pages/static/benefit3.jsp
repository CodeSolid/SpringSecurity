        <h1>Get it Free, It Stays Free</h1>
        <p>Whenever I see a site that's "free during our beta period", I always wonder
           what ugly price I'll pay after the beta period.</p>
        <p>To save you from having to worry about that here, here's the answer:  It will be free afterwards, too.
           All users who sign up during our beta period and enter at least one task for themselves will automatically
           be signed up for free basic account when our beta period ends.  So lets say at that time we still have a free
           option and a basic option that sells for $5, or $9, or $20 per month -- whatever it is.  Well, if you took
           a chance on our software when it was still young and ugly, we think you should get a free basic account
           when it gets to be mature and wonderful.</p>
        <p>We don't want to just build great software.  We want to build great software with passionate users who let us
           know where we need to improve.  So sign up for a free account today, and when it turns not free, well,
           if you signed up that early in the process, it'll still be free for you even when it isn't free for all your
           unlucky friends.</p>
        <p>You can brag about it if you want.  We won't mind.</p>
